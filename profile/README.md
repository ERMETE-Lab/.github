Engineering for nuclear Reactors probleMs with advancEd simulaTions and modElling (ERMETE) at Nuclear Reactors Group (NRG) in Politecnico di Milano.

The codes have been developed by the lab under the supervision of Prof. Antonio Cammi at [Nuclear Reactors Group](https://www.nuclearenergy.polimi.it/) in [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).

The organisation collect several topics covered within the research lab, here below a brief summary is reported.

- **MP** (Multi-Physics): modelling of nuclear reactors adopting a Multi-Physics perspective, by considering the inter-connections between different physical fields (e.g., neutronics and thermal-hydraulics). In addition, innovative concepts of reactors and techniques to simulate flows are investigated.
- **ROSE** (Reduced Order multi-phySics data-drivEn): mathematical algorithms aimed at reducing the complexity of multi-physics models (for nuclear reactors applications), at searching for optimal sensor positions and at integrating real measures to improve the knowledge on the physical systems.
- **MHD** (Magneto-HydroDynamic): *work in progress*
