## About Us

The ERMETE lab is led by **Prof. Antonio Cammi** and is part of the [Nuclear Reactors Group](https://www.nuclearenergy.polimi.it/) at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/). Our research covers a broad range of topics in nuclear engineering, focusing on multi-physics modeling, reduced order modeling, and data-driven techniques.

## Research Areas

### Multi-Physics (MP)
- **Objective:** Model nuclear reactors by considering the inter-connections between different physical fields such as neutronics and thermal-hydraulics.
- **Focus:** Investigate innovative reactor concepts and advanced flow simulation techniques.

### Reduced Order Modelling with Data-Driven Techniques for Multi-Physics Problems (ROSE)
- **Objective:** Develop numerical algorithms to reduce the complexity of multi-physics models for nuclear reactor applications.
- **Focus:** Optimize sensor placement and integrate real measurements to enhance the understanding of physical systems.

### Magneto-HydroDynamic (MHD)
- **Status:** *Work in progress*
- **Focus:** Develop and apply MHD techniques to nuclear reactor systems.
