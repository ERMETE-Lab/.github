# ERMETE - Engineering for nuclear Reactors probleMs with advancEd simulaTions and modElling 

Welcome to the **ERMETE** research lab within the **Nuclear Reactors Group (NRG)** in **Politecnico di Milano**. We are dedicated to advancing nuclear reactor technology through innovative simulations and modeling techniques.



## About Us üè´

The ERMETE lab is led by **Prof. Antonio Cammi** and is part of the [Nuclear Reactors Group](https://www.nuclearenergy.polimi.it/) at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/). Our research covers a broad range of topics in nuclear engineering, focusing on multi-physics modeling, reduced order modeling, and data-driven techniques.

## Research Areas üîç

### Multi-Physics (MP) ‚öõÔ∏è
- **Objective:** Modelling nuclear reactors by considering the inter-connections between different physical fields such as neutronics and thermal-hydraulics and investigation of innovative reactor concepts and advanced flow simulation techniques.

### Reduced Order Modelling with Data-Driven Techniques for Multi-Physics Problems (ROSE) ü§ñ
- **Objective:** Develop numerical algorithms to reduce the complexity of multi-physics models for nuclear reactor applications, optimize sensor placement and integrate real measurements to enhance the understanding of physical systems, pushing forward the development of digital twins.

### Magneto-HydroDynamic (MHD) üß≤
- **Objective:** Develop an open-source OpenFOAM library for MHD simulations, with a particular emphasis on practical applications within the domain of magnetic confinement fusion.
